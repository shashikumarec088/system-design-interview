# Payment System

## Real-life examples
- **Digital wallet**
   - Apple Pay
   - Google Pay
- **Online payment platform**
   - PayPal
   - Stripe
   - Square

## Concepts
- **Payment options**
   - Credit/Debit cards
      - Card network: Visa, MasterCard
         - POS terminal / Online
         - Contact / Contactless (NFC)
      - Online payment platform (PayPal, Stripe, Square)
      - Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
      - Direct debit (This method allows authorized parties to directly withdraw funds from a customer's bank account, often used for recurring payments like utility bills).
      - Checks / Money orders
- **Payment Service Provider (PSP) / Payment processors / Payment gateway**
   - A third-party company that allows businesses to accept electronic payments, such as credit cards and debit cards payments.
   - Examples: Paypal, Stripe, Square, Braintree, Adyen, Galileo
- **Reconciliation**
   - A method of bookkeeping that compares financial records that are logged internally with records that are logged in PSP, to make sure the accounting is accurate.
- **Double-entry bookkeeping**
   - A transaction always affects at least two accounts, always includes at least one debit and one credit, and always has total debits and total credits that are equal.
     
     | Account | Debit | Credit |
     |----|----|----|
     | Buyer | $5 | |
     | Seller | | $5 |
- **Compliance**
   - *Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)*: The standard outlines security requirements for organizations that handle credit card information.
   - *Anti-Money Laundering (AML)*: The laws prevent money laundering activities.
   - *Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)*: The term prevents and detects the use of funds for financing acts of terrorism.
   - *Know Your Customer (KYC)*: The regulation verifys the identities of customers before allowing financial transactions. 

## Requirements clarification
- **Functional requirements**
   - Support money movement for an e-commerce application:
      - Pay-in flow: Receive money from customers on behalf of sellers once customers place orders.
      - Pay-out flow: Send money to sellers once the products are delivered and money is released.

        ![pay-in-out](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8989447/188941477-5734acbe-5aba-4820-a252-990291c5fa3c.png)
   - The payment system should support all the payment options
   - Use third-party PSP for credit card payment processing.
- **Non-functional requirements**
   - Fault tolerance (Failed payments need to be handled carefully).
   - A reconciliation process between internal services (payment services, accounting services, etc.) and external services (payment service providers, etc.)
      - When a service fails, different services may run into inconsistent states. So we need to execute the reconciliation process to fix any inconsistent payment information among all services.

## Estimation
- **Traffic estimation**
   - Assume 1,000,000 transactions per day.
   - TPS = 1,000,000 transactions / 10<sup>5</sup> = 10 transactions per second.
- **Storage estimation**
- **Bandwidth estimation**

## System interface definition
- **POST** `/v1/payments`
   - Function: Execute a payment event.
   - Request body
     ```json
     {
       "buyer_info" : {},
       "checkout_id" : "",
       "credit_card_info" : {},
       "payment_orders": [
         {
           "seller_account" : "",
           "amount" : "",
           "currency" : "",
           "payment_order_id": ""
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Notes
      - `payment_order_id`: It is userd by the PSP as the deduplication ID, also called the idempotency key/token.
      - `amount`: The type of this field is string, not double.
- **GET** `/v1/payments/{:id}`
   - Function: Get the execution status of a single payment order.

## Data model definition
- **Schema**
   - Table 1: Payment event
      - Description
         - Stores detailed payment event inforamtion.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK/FK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | checkout_id | string | PK | |
        | buyer_info | string | | |
        | seller_info | string | | |
        | credit_card_info | string | | |
        | is_payment_done | boolean | | |

- ** question**
  - how multiple sellers' info is stored in the payment event table
        
   - Table 2: Payment order
      - Description
         - Stores the execution status of each payment order.
      - Columns
        | Column Name | Column Type | PK/FK | Description |
        |----|----|----|----|
        | payment_order_id | string | PK | The unique identifier for payment orders.  |
        | buyer_account | string | | The account identifier of buyer. |
        | amount | string | | The amount of the transaction. |
        | currency | string | | The currency of the transaction. |
        | checkout_id | string | FK | The foreign key to the payment event table's `checkout_id`. |
        | payment_order_status | string | | The status of the payment order. The value can be: <ul><li>`NOT_STARTED`<li>`EXECUTING`<li>`SUCCESS`<li>`FAILED`</ul> |
        | ledger_updated | boolean | | |
        | wallet_updated | boolean | | |
- **Database**
  - Traditional relational database with ACID
     - Reasons
        - The financial sector requires greater uniformity rather than just accessibility.
        - Proven stability: Whether the storage system has been used by other big financial companys for many years with positive feedback.

## High-level design

- **Components**
   - Payment service
      - Accepts payment events (one event may contain multiple payment orders) from users and coordinates the payment process.
   - Payment executor
      - Executes a single payment order via a Payment Service Provider (PSP).
   - Payment Service Provider (PSP)
      - Moves money from one account to another.
   - Card schemas
      - The organizations that process credit card operations.
   - Ledger
      - Stores transaction history.
   - Wallet
      - Stores accounts' balances.
   - Reconciliation
      - Parses the settlement file and compare it with the ledger system.
- **Key points**
   - Don't store the credit card information.
      - Use hosted credit card pages provided from PSP
   - Ledger will follow the double-entry bookkeeping principle.
- **Processes**
   - Process after a user clicks the "place order" button:
      - (1) A payment event is generated and sent to the payment service.
      - (2) The payment service stores the payment event in the database.
      - (3) The payment service sends a payment order to the payment executor.
      - (4) The payment executor stores the payment order in the database.
      - (5) The payment executor calls an external PSP to process the credit card payment.
      - (6) After the payment executor has successfully executed the payment, the payment service will update the wallet to record how much money a given seller has.
      - (7) The wallet server stores the updated balance information in the database.
      - (8) After the wallet service has successfully updated the sellerâ€™s balance information, the payment service will call the ledger to save the transaction history.
      - (9) The ledger service adds the new transaction history to the database.
      - (10) The reconciliation system parses the settlement file and compare it with the ledage system.
- **Notes**
   - Payment event and payment order
      - A payment event may contain several payment orders.
      - A user may select multiple products from multiple sellers in a single checkout process. The system splits the checkout into multiple payment orders.
   - Settlement file
      - Every night the PSP or banks send a settlement file to their clients.
      - Contains the balance of the bank account, together with all the transactions that took place on this bank account during the day.

## Detailed design
### PSP integration
![PSP Integration drawio](https://github.com/wuyichen24/system-design-interview/assets/8989447/5fa31425-a764-42fb-b1a0-5d8024581f26)

- **Key points**
   - The payment system doesn't store the credit card information, it will use hosted credit card pages provided from PSP and let PSP collect credit card information directly.

### Reconciliation
- **Purpose**
   - Fix the inconsistency between the financial records logged internally with the records logged in PSP externally.
- **Process**
   - Every night the PSP send a settlement file to the company.
   - The reconciliation system parses the settlement file and compares the details with the ledger system.
   - The financial team performs manual adjustments on the mismatches.
